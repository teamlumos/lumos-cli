# Commit Message Format

Follow the Angular commit message convention for all commits. This format creates an easier-to-read commit history and enables automated changelog generation.

## Structure

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

<body>

<footer>
```

## Header Format (Required)

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
```

- **type**: Required. See types below.
- **scope**: Optional. The area of the codebase affected.
- **summary**: Required. Present tense, no capitalization, no period at the end.

### Commit Types

### Summary Rules

- Use imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- Don't capitalize the first letter
- No period (.) at the end
- Keep under 72 characters

## Body (Optional but Recommended)

- Use imperative, present tense
- Explain the **motivation** for the change
- Explain **why** you are making the change, not just what
- Compare previous behavior with new behavior if helpful
- Must be at least 20 characters if included
- Wrap at 72 characters

## Footer (Optional)

Used for:
- Breaking changes
- Deprecations  
- Issue references

### Breaking Changes

```
BREAKING CHANGE: <summary>

<description + migration instructions>

Fixes #<issue number>
```

### Deprecations

```
DEPRECATED: <what is deprecated>

<description + recommended update path>

Closes #<pr number>
```

### Issue References

```
Fixes #123
Closes #456
Refs #789
```

## Examples

### Feature with scope
```
feat(cli): add verbose logging option

Add --verbose flag to enable detailed output during command execution.
This helps users debug issues with API calls.

Closes #42
```

### Bug fix
```
fix(auth): handle expired token refresh correctly

Previously, expired tokens would cause a crash instead of
triggering a refresh flow. Now the client properly catches
the expiration and requests a new token.

Fixes #128
```

### Documentation
```
docs: update README with installation steps
```

### Breaking change
```
feat(api): change response format to JSON

BREAKING CHANGE: API responses are now JSON instead of XML.

Migrate by updating response parsers to handle JSON format.
See migration guide in docs/migration-v2.md.

Closes #200
```

### Revert
```
revert: feat(cli): add verbose logging option

This reverts commit abc1234.

The verbose mode was causing performance issues in production.
```

## Quick Reference

✅ Good:
- `feat(auth): add OAuth2 support`
- `fix: resolve memory leak in worker pool`
- `docs: add API reference for new endpoints`

❌ Bad:
- `Fixed bug` (no type, past tense, vague)
- `feat: Added new feature.` (past tense, has period)
- `FEAT: Add Feature` (wrong case)
- `feat(auth)add oauth` (missing colon after scope)
